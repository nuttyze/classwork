  What I learned this year was how to use fieldset tag and legend tag how fieldset puts a box around the from stuff and how legend tag gives the fieldset box a title.

    What did I not learn this year was how to the loop I still got some problems with it i know a lil bit abt it but not to much like where do i put and how to use.

    what I would have liked to do better on this year was is make my html faster and learn how loop works and try to do stuff by myself than asking people for help with my work.
