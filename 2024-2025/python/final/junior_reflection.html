  What I learned This year, I learned how to use the fieldset and legend tags. The fieldset puts a box around form stuff, and the legend gives it a title.

    what I did not learn this year I still don’t really get how loops work. I kinda know a little, but I’m not sure where to use them or how to write them the right way.

    what I would have liked to do better on this year I wish I got better at writing HTML faster, learned how loops work more, and tried to do things on my own instead of always asking for help.</p>
